# ACF Pygame Exercises (BHA)

This repository contains a variety of assignments and demos to be used by ACF (Applied Computing Foundation) coaches for the BHA (Branksome Hall Asia) summer camp.

This list is not exhaustive and is sorted by day.

## How To Use

Every folder represents a single day, with comments inside of every file
introducing the problem statement and templated code. To work with the code:

1. download/clone this repository
2. find a day's respective folder and its `main.py` file (and other files in the folder if provided)
3. ensure Python is installed on your computer and start coding!<br/>

_Alternatively, you may also copy the code of a file and paste it into an environment that can run Python like [the Replit website](https://replit.com/~)._

### Day-by-Day Exercises

##### Day 1: Drawing Shapes, Movement, and Frames

-   `template.py`: A template that should be downloaded by students. Contains baseline code that creates an empty Pygame window.
-   `001-draw.py`: Primer to Pygame that demonstrates how to draw shapes onto the screen.
    -   Content: `pygame.draw.rect()`, `pygame.draw.circle()`
    -   Exercise: Draw a rendition of a flag design!
-   `002-move.py`: Introduction to saving global variables to store data and receiving keyboard input from the user.
    -   Content: `pygame.key.get_pressed()`
    -   Exercise: The code provided only shows how to receive keyboard input, and create player coordinates. Connect these up, and make the player move based on key presses!
-   `003-ticks.py`: Looking into the concept of frames per second (FPS) to make games ALWAYS run at the same speed, no matter how fast one's computer is!
    -   Content: `pygame.time.Clock()`, `pygame.time.Clock.tick()`
    -   Exercise: Add local multiplayer functionality! Create another player, and allow that player to move around using different keys (e.g., one player uses WASD and the other uses arrow keys).
