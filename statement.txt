Q: How will AI be integrated into the Python/Pygame curriculum?

A: > We'll look at some successes and flops in the video gaming industry 
that use artificial intelligence to control behaviors. From the entities 
that make Minecraft feel like Minecraft to the artificial conversations 
in the indie game Suck Up!, we'll explore different ways to make games 
feel more fun by introducing unpredictability with AI. Also, video game 
development isn't easy, so we highly encourage students to utilize online 
chatbots to explain unfamiliar code. We'll also explore how to use different 
buzzwords to get the results we want.
